    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Adventurous people with big travel dreams need a way to discover, prioritize, and share the items on their bucket list in order to organize goals, connect with like-minded peers, and gain inspiration for future trips.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A mobile application that allows the user to create, search, and share bucket list goals. Then notify their online community when these goals are completed.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <p>Young Millennials with big travel dreams, who wants to share and receive travel inspiration.</p>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>To create a tool that would help travelers book their next vacation. I conducted research, discovered an opportunity, then built a prototype for usability testing over the course of 4 weeks. This project started with a broad goal and required inductive reasoning to find a problem and solution.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     <h3 id="empathizeBB">Empathize / User Research</h3>
     <p>I did some initial research and found that the demographic who travels the most were Millenials between the ages of <b>23</b> and <b>38</b>, so I decided to focus on this group. I created a <b>proto-persona</b> based on my assumptions of the potential user. Next I developed a research and interview plan to discover customer needs - This involved <b>5 interviews</b> and a <b>survey</b> on social media. I wanted to see what motivated people to travel, how often they did it, and what their process was like for planning.</p>

      <img src="images/bucketBookImages/protoPersona1.png" class="caseStudyMedImg" title="Proto-Persona">
   </div>

     <p> I synthesized all of the insigns that I gathered based on the naturally occurring themes, creating this <b>affinity diagram.</b></p>

      <h3 id="defineBB">Define</h3>
    <p>While doing my research I learned that this demographic likes to be active and have new experiences that they can share on social media. Several participants mentioned <b>wanting to cross items off of their bucket list.</b> I noticed that most of these people got their travel inspiration from social media, like Instagram and the survey showed that <b>73%</b> of their travel was for pleasure. With these findings I created a <b>user persona</b> and <b>empathy map.</b></p>

        <h3 id="ideationBB">Ideation</h3>
        <p>After learning about the potential user needs, I <b>jotted down some ideas</b> of how an application could help solve them. I used the <b>"I like, I wish, what if"</b> method to brainstorm features, then the <b>"how, now, wow"</b> method to prioritize the features.</p>
            <div class="caseStudyThreeImgContainer">
               <div class="ThreeImgContainer">
                 <img src="images/bucketBookImages/Bucket_List_feature_brainstorm.png" class="caseStudySmallImg" title="Brainstorm">

      <p>My <b>value proposition</b> was a mobile application that allows the user to create a profile where they can add items to their bucket list. Users can share goals and accomplishments with their peers. Next I created a <b>storyboard</b> and <b>user journey map</b> to illustrate how this might work.</p>

        <h3 id="prototypingBB">Prototyping</h3>
        <p>While creating a <b>competitor analysis</b> I found another app called Bucket that is similar, but it didn't allow users to create lists in different categories, so I moved forward with the assumption that this product can add value and differentiate itself by allowing users to create multiple lists with different catagories for similar goals. <b>Here is a user flow showing how the application will work.</b></p>
      
        <img src="images/bucketBookImages/BB_User_flow1.jpg" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="User Flow">
        <p>Once I had the user flow, I <b>sketched wireframes</b> and transfered them to Figma, where I created a <b>lo-fi clickable prototype.</b></p>

            <h3 id="testingBB">Testing</h3>
            <p>I created a testing plan then I conducted <b>5 user feedback sessions</b> over Zoom. I made an <b>affinity diagram</b> from the user insights and then moved the opportunities to a <b>2x2 matrix</b> that compared the priority for customers and the business to help me decide what I should change in the next iteration.</p>
            
                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
                  
                  <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">
                    <img src="images/bucketBookImages/BB_prototype.gif" class="caseStudySmallImg" title="User Feedback Session">
                  </div>

                  <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">
                    <img src="images/bucketBookImages/2x2_matrix.png" class="caseStudySmallImg" title="2x2 Matrix">
                  </div>

                </div>
               
                <p>The results from the tests were clear to me. The onboarding process lacked clarity, causing confusion to users. I also needed to deactivate the state of some buttons when they are not useable. I followed Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines to create the next iteration of the prototype. Then I did a round of usability testing - this led me to switch the Sign Up and Sign In buttons, change the order of items on user posts, widen user input fields and more.</p>
                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
                  
                  <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

                  </div>

                </div>

                <p>Finally, I created a style guide and applied the styles to create hi-fi mockups:</p>
               <div>
                <img src="images/bucketBookImages/bucketBook_mock2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>I started this project without any direction because I wanted to let the interviews guide the problem and solution. In the beginning, I was a bit overwhelmed with how broad the scope was and it was a challenge to draw conclusions from the data while working alone. I feel like I had a breakthrough by having a brainstorming session with a TA from my UX/UI class at Georgia Tech. They were able to help me recognize some patterns in the data that I was not able to see while working alone. This is where the idea for a bucket list app came from. <br><br>
                       

                        Through this process, I learned how valuable collaboration is. Design thinking is difficult to do alone, getting feedback from other people who have a different viewpoint than you is a necessity. While so many of the people that I interviewed had the same pain points and goals, it was not always easy to decipher what that meant. Sometimes finding the problem is more difficult than creating a solution.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        I found the usability testing to be extremely helpful, with only 5 tests I was able to see shortcomings in my design that I was able to fix in a day. My prototypes only covered sign up and sign in as well as onboarding, viewing the Home page and creating lists. There are many other features that need to be explored. I really only scratched the surface with what I learned and created here.<br><br>
