      <h3>Web Design Case Study</h3>
      <p>UX/UI Web Design project with Tshlene Bentley, Leah Schwartz, Bao Tran, and Laila Walsh.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>A budget conscious pet owner needs the ability to learn how to have their pets spayed or neutered in the most efficient and cost effective way, so they don't waste their precious time and money.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A complete redesign of Georgia Animal Project’s website, with clear navigation, and a bold call-to-action to maximize conversion.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Budget conscious pet owners who need to have their pet spayed or neutered.</li>
     <li>Enthusiastic animal lovers who want to volunteer or donate to the cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The Goal of this project was to use <b>design thinking</b> to create and test solutions that improve the user experience and create better outcomes for the business. My team conducted user research, interviewed the owner as well as people who have had their pet spayed or neutered in the past. This way we could move forward with empathy for everyone involved, as we made data-driven decisions on how to redesign Georgia Animal Project's website.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

      <a href="#empathize"><img src="images/designIcons/empathize_icon.png" class="designIcon"></a>

     <h3 id="empathize">Empathize / Research</h3>
     <p>We created a <b>proto-persona</b> based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need animal spay / neuter services.</p>
    
    <div class="caseStudyMedImgContainer">
      <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_Proto-Persona2.png" class="caseStudyMedImg" title="Proto-Persona">
   </div>
    <p>Then we conducted <b>5</b> user interviews and surveyed <b>31</b> participants. As a group, using Miro and Zoom, we <b>synthesized</b> the data into an <b>affinity diagram</b> of user insights. <b>Here is a list of our findings:</b></p>
    <ul>
     <li><b>61%</b> want to have their pet spayed/neutered to reduce animal overpopulation.</li>
     <li>Participants don’t want to deal with the hassle of having a pet that can reproduce, because it can be messy and lead to unwanted litters from their pet.</li>
     <li>Participants want to do the responsible thing by having their pet fixed, because unwanted litters will contribute to animal overpopulation and unnecessary euthanasia.</li>
     <li>Participants want to save time and money.</li>
  
    </ul>

     <p>I contacted the owner of Georgia Animal Project, Cindy Foster, and she shared with me her need for donors.</p>
    
     <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <img src="images/designIcons/quote_icon_start.png" class="quoteIconStart">
      <p><i>“We service rescue groups, shelters, community programs and the public at large. We would also like to continue educating the public on the importance of spay/neuter and humane care.  In addition, we need to grab the attention of potential donors.“</i> - Cindy Foster (owner)</p>
  
    </blockquote>
    
  
      <h3 id="define">Define</h3>
    <p>Once we gathered and synthesized all of the data from our initial interviews and survey, we were able to create a <b>user persona</b> that was data-driven.</p>
 
    <div class="caseStudyMedImgContainer">
      <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_userPersona1.png" class="caseStudyMedImg" title="User Persona">
   </div>
    
    <p>I created this <b>Value Proposition Canvas</b> and <b>Empathy Map</b> to help us get a better understanding of the user's needs and pain points as well as how they relate to the business:</p>
    <div>
      <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">

      </div>
    </div>
      <p>Georgia Animal Project's website had no real call to action. It was difficult for the user to get in-touch, donate, volunteer or schedule services because the site just listed phone numbers and email addresses, but had <b>no real call-to-action</b> so we decided to focus on that moving forward. This is important becasue GAP depends on users reaching out to them.</p>
     <div>
        <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">

        <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
        <p>Our group collaborated to prioritize the features that we would like to change in order to improve GAP’s web experience. There were many opportunities, so we used <b>dot voting</b> through Miro and Zoom to narrow it down. <b>Here are the improvements that we wanted to focu on:</b></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Navigation / IA</li>
               <li>Drawing the user to the desired CTA</li>
               <li>Imagery and layout</li>
           </ul> 
           <p>We did a <b>card sorting</b> exercise on all of the site contents to come up with a solution for the new navigation, then we started <b>sketching wireframes</b>. We believed that if we reorganized the information, media, and navigation on Georgia Animal Project’s website, users would be able to find the information that they are looking for more easily, resulting in an increase in procedures, donations and volunteers.</p>

            </div>
           </div>     
      <p>We created a <b>storyboard</b> that illustrates how our user persona, Sydney, would interact with the website to solve her problem.</p>   
      <div>
        <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_StoryBoard1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Storyboard">
      </div>
        <h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
       <p>I used Figma to create a <b>lo-fi prototype</b> so that we could test the new information architecture. We conducted <b>user feedback sessions</b> with <b>5</b> participants.</p>
       
       <div class="caseStudyMedImgContainer">
        <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_lo-fiWireframe.png" class="caseStudyMedImg" title="Lo-Fi Prototype">
     </div>
       
        <p><b>Here are the insights from the user feedback sessions:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>100%</b> wanted to know who they are donating to and how the money will be used.</li>
                    <li><b>80%</b> want to see testimonials.</li>
                    <li><b>20%</b> were confused by the wording of the menu item called “The Process.”</li>
                </ul>
        <p>After getting these results from our tests, we knew what to change when creating the next version. I created a few hi-fi mockups with different ideas for the navigation layout. Then we conducted a survey and found that <b>83%</b> prefer the first design, so we decided to move forward with that.</p>
          <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_navIdeas1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Navigation A/B Test">
       <p>As the conversation developed with Cindy from GAP, she shared with me that <b>the bottleneck in their operation was access to volunteers</b>, so we decided to add a button for this in the primary navigation. I created this <b>style guide</b> so that I could build a hi-fi prototype next:</p>
        <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_styleGuide3.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Style Guide">
            
        <h3 id="testing">Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>I built this <b>hi-fi prototype</b> that inculded all of the changes that we felt we needed to make based on our first round of tests, as well as conversations with stakeholders. We added the Volunteer button, and we focused on testimonials, making them a part of every page to build customer trust. Then we conducted <b>5</b> usability tests to vaildate our changes.</p>
            <img src="images/GAPImages/GAP_hi-fi_prototype1.png" class="caseStudyLargeImg" title="Hi-Fi Prototype">
              <p><b>Insights from our usability tests:</b></p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>100%</b> expect a toast notification and confirmation email when tasks are completed.</li>
                  <li><b>60%</b> expect more details in the booking process.</li>
                  <li><b>40%</b> expect a drop down menu on “The Process.”</li>
                  <li><b>40%</b> wanted a simpler explanation on the “Home” page.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

            </div>
                <p>I conducted <b>A/B testing</b> on the primary menu item “The Process” to see if users wanted a drop-down menu instead of links to advance the page once you are there. <b>66%</b> prefer the drop down menu, so we decided to go with that. I updated all of the mockups, <b>here are the designs for desktop, table, and mobile:</b></p>
              <div class="">

              </div>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>We believe that our redesign has made it much easier for people to engage with and learn about Georgia Animal Project. The information is organized better and it’s more accessible. Donating, volunteering, and booking can all be done in just a few clicks. This should drastically improve engagement, increase donations, spay/neuter procedures, and volunteer signup for Georgia Animal Project. We never came up with a better title from the menu item "The Process." If we were to continue working on this project, that is something that we would like to explore.</p>
