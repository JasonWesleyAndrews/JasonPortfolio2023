           <p>Welcome! I’m Jason, a Prodcut Designer and for the last two years I have been working at Carestream Dental, striving to improve their cloud-based dental software, <a class="textLink" href="https://gosensei.com/pages/sensei-cloud" target="_blank">Sensei Cloud</a>, where I led the design of 12+ features and improvements for the web app. Notably, I created a family billing feature that saves users 32 clicks, and almost 2 minutes per family billed, I built and maintained our component library and design system in Figma. Additionally, I piloted a continuous discovery program and played a pivotal role in expanding the UX team from 1 to 5 members.<br>
            <br>Prior to joining CareStream, I served as a UX/UI designer at Tech for Campaigns, where I collaborated with a cross-functional team to design Matt Koleszar's re-election website. Our efforts proved fruitful, as Matt emerged victorious in the election!<br>
           <br>My passion lies in uncovering customer needs and delivering tailored UX solutions that generate user delight as well as tangible value for the business. I believe in the significance of data-informed decisions and value the iterative refinement of designs, because embracing feedback almost always leads to continuous improvements.<br>
           <br>Over the past decade, I've continually deepened my expertise across various tech disciplines. I've acquired experience spanning every facet of the product development lifecycle. Noteworthy certifications include UX/UI from Georgia Tech and Product Management from General Assembly in 2021. I also completed the Front-End Development program through Treehouse and undertook the training to become a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO).<br>
           <br>I have the soft skills necessary for seamless stakeholder collaboration and the technical understanding to explore feasibility with developers. I can spearhead UX research, facilitate usability testing, and swiftly articulate designs through sketches, wireframes, hi-fidelity mockups, and prototypes as needed. I take pride in using clear communication to drive decisions and foster alignment within the teams that I work with.<br>
          </p>
          <img class="aboutMeImgLeft" src="images/jason_mastering.png">
          <p>In the past, I ran <a class="textLink" href="https://voyageatl.com/interview/meet-jason-andrews-spotlight-sound-studio-alpharetta/" target="_blank">Spotlight Sound Studio</a>, a recording studio offering digital audio production services, where I owned the UX for all customer touch points. Notably, my studio held the distinction of being the #1 recording studio in Alpharetta, GA. This is where I honed my expertise in project management while delivering high-quality products, skillfully balancing scope, schedule, and cost.<br>
            <br>My journey into the recording industry was fueled by my passion as a musician and multi-instrumentalist. From singing to playing guitar, drums, bass, and the keyboard, music has been an integral part of my life since childhood, leading me to perform in numerous bands and travel extensively across the US, Canada, and Japan. This connection with music culminated in a degree in Recording Arts and the establishment of my recording business.<br>         
          <br>Throughout my career, I have consistently navigated the realm of technology, managing files, people, and projects, which fueled my curiosity for digital product management and coding. Over the years, I have continuously enriched my knowledge through classes on Front-End Development, Product Management, and UX/UI Design, research methodology, web accessibility and more.<br>
          <img style="margin-top: 30px" class="aboutMeImg" src="images/JA_flatiron_map.jpg">
          <br>In my leisure time, I find joy in exploring new places and indulging in hobbies like building and flying RC helicopters, propagating plants, and embracing mountaineering and rock climbing as my primary passion. I get immense satisfaction from working in tandem with a partner to overcome challenges, adhering to meticulous safety systems and equipment, and ultimately reaching the summit when climbing mountains.<br>
          <br>Thank you for visiting my design portfolio, a testament to my enduring dedication to design excellence, continuous growth, and the relentless pursuit of new frontiers.
