          <h3>Mobile Application Product Design Case Study</h3>
          <p>Product design project with Stephanie Shahbazi, and June Muthee, from the winter of 2021. I was a designer and front-end developer on a cross-functional team that completed this project over the course of 4 weeks</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Individuals contemplating an international move, particularly those unfamiliar with the intricacies of the process, require a comprehensive resource to enlighten them on the disparities between the cultures of the two countries involved.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>A mobile application that allows users to learn and compare important information and gain the necessary resources needed when considering relocating to a new country.</p>
        <h3>The User</h3>
        <p>Adults who are considering moving to a new country and want more information delivered quickly on what it will be like to relocate.</p>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a digital solution to an everyday problem. Our group brainstormed ideas and then used <b>dot voting</b> to decide how to move forward. We came up with the concept of creating a product that will make international travel easier.</p>
        <h3>The Process</h3>

         <p>I created a <b>proto-persona</b> based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need information on international relocation.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We <b>interviewed 8</b> potential users and <b>distributed a survey</b> via social media to gain additional insights. Our primary goal was to understand the needs of users who are moving internationally. After we collected all of our user insights, we used Miro to create an <b>Affinity Diagram</b> that helped us synthesize the data. <b>Here is what we found:</b></p>
        <ul>
         <li><b>70%</b> of respondents said their top concern when moving to a new country is making sure they have the correct documents and visas.</li>
         <li><b>65%</b> of survey respondents felt excited about moving abroad.</li>
         <li><b>58%</b> have relocated to a different country in the past.</li>
         <li>Users said that the most important information to have when moving to a different country is the cost of living, cultural differences, social norms, and crime/safety information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on our research findings, we created this <b>user persona</b> and <b>empathy map</b> to document our user's goals, and emotions:</p>

       </div>
    
         <p>During user interviews, we discovered that individuals who moved internationally were most concerned with safety and learning about cultural and social rules.
          Our hypothesis was that individuals moving abroad will have a less stressful and smoother experience if they had all the related information in one place.

            <p>Our user interviews and survey gave us insights into what information international movers are looking for, we created a <b>feature matrix</b> to help us decide what information our application should provide to the user. Here are our findings in terms of what information the user wants:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Resources on how to obtain a travel visa.</li>
                   <li>Important cultural differences.</li>
                   <li>Insurance options.</li>
                   <li>Crime and safety comparison.</li>
                   <li>Cost of living / economic comparison and banking resources.</li>
                   <li>Salary conversion / comparison.</li>
                   <li>Shipping options for large personal items.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>The participants from our study said that <b>this information would be most convenient if it were delivered through a mobile application</b> that would give users a snapshot of what it would take to relocate to a new country. We brainstormed on how to build the app and created a style tile that had some initial styles, it was enough to get started. </p>
          
    
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

             <p>Now we needed a solution that could give the user the information that they wanted. Our first <b>user flow</b> involved a results page that fanned out into links to each search category being displayed on it's own page.</p>
               <div>
                <img src="images/moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow1.jpg" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="User Flow 1">
              </div>
              <p>Because this required extra work to design, and it woud cause the user to make several unnecessary taps, <b>we decided to make the results page scrollable and have it contain all of the information.</b></p>
              <div>
               <img src="images/moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="User Flow 2">
             </div>
             <p>I sketched up a few <b>wireframes</b> to start working out a way to organize the informarion on the screen. That inspired this <b>site map</b>:</p>
               <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

             </div>
    
    
                
          <p>We created a <b>storyboard</b> that illustrates how the user might use moveAbroad.</p>

            <h3 id="prototyping" class="caseStudyAnchor">Prototyping</h3>
           
            <p>In figma I created a basic <b>wireframe prototype</b> of the app and I led <b>5</b> user feedback sessions. <b>Here are the questions that we wanted answers to:</b></p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Do users understand the concept of our user flow?</li>
                <li>Is the text on the buttons understandable?</li>
                <li>What do users think about providing their personal information?</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <img src="images/moveAbroadImages/wireframe1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Wireframes">
              </div>
           
              <p><b>Here are the insights from our user feedback sessions:</b></p>
              <ul>
                  
                  <li><b>80%</b> expect the “city input field” on the Home page to have auto-complete funtionallity instead of a dropdown menu to select the location.</li>
                  <li><b>60%</b> expect the onboarding copy to explain why the app needs the users information, some users had data privacy concerns.</li>
                  <li>The user should create their username and password in the onboarding process, not on the Sign Up / Sign In page.</li>
                  <li>The Results page should have a sticky footer with ‘back’ and ‘profile’ page links.</li>
                 
              </ul>
         
    
                <h3 id="testing" class="caseStudyAnchor">Testing</h3>
               
                
                    
                    <p>We used the insights from our user feedback sessions to iterate on the design and added the initial colors from the style tile to make a mid-fidelity prototype to conduct <b>5 usability tests.</b></p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_midFi_prototype.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Mid-Fidelidity Mockups">
                      </div>
                    <p><b>Here are the user insights from our usability test:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>80%</b> want a back button on the results page.</li>
                      <li><b>40%</b> are confused by the page being called Home.</li>
                      <li><b>40%</b> feel like the orange buttons look destructive, like a warning.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                   <p>Using this <b>style guide</b> and the results from the <b>usability test</b>, I coded a web-based prototype using <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <b>JavaScript.</b> I switched the Sign Up button with Sign In so that the input fileds are grouped with the Sign In button. We made the background blue color more muted to make it more visually appealing and acessible to people with vision limitations. I changed the name of the Home page to Search because that is what the user is doing there. I added a Back button on the footer.
                   </p>
    
                       
    
                       <div>

                    <p>The hi-fi prototype passed the final round of usability tests. <b>100%</b> of the tasks were completed successfully! <b>Here is what we came up with:</b></p>
                      <div>
                        <img src="images/moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_hi-fi_all.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder" title="Coded Designs">

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>This was diffrent from all of the other projects that I've worked on because I coded the final prototype. If we were to do more testing and iterations we would want to add and test the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comparison of multiple cities.</li>
                            <li>Ability to "favorite" or save searches.</li>
                            <li>Copy that makes users feel like their data is safe.</li>
                            <li>Moving the 'Back' button from the primary navigation to the top-left of the screen (a convention in iOS).</li>
    
                        </ul>
